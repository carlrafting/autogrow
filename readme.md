# autogrow

## What is autogrow?

autogrow consists two files. One CSS file and one JavaScript file. autogrows purpose is to make `textarea`s on the web, more elegant and less frustrating to use.

It does this by expanding the height of the `textarea`, depending on the amount of content it contains. This solves the problem of having to scroll inside the textarea, which can be a frustrating experience, especially on mobile devices.

You can read more in the article [Expanding Text Areas Made Elegant](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/expanding-text-areas-made-elegant/) by _Neil Jenkins_, where some of the code is adapted from.

## How to Use autogrow

Using autogrow is simple. Simply call `autogrow()` by providing the element to select as the first argument.

```js
// get element by id
autogrow('textarea')

// get element with id selector
autogrow('#textarea')

// get element with class selector
autogrow('.textarea')

// get element by id and provide custom styling options
autogrow('textarea', {
  areaClass: 'my-area-class'
  containerClass: 'my-container-class'
  activeClass: 'my-active-class'
  mirrorClass: 'my-mirror-class'
  spanClass: 'my-span-class'
})

// create textarea and run it through autogrow
var textarea = document.createElement('textarea');
var ret = autogrow(textarea);
// append results to DOM
document.body.appendChild(ret.container);
```

* Accepts `HTMLTextAreaElement` as `target` argument to `autogrow()`. May or may not exist in DOM.
* Creates DOM Elements with `document.createElement()` instead of setting string values on `Element.innerHTML`
* It's now possible to use `autogrow()` for targeting individual elements.
* `autogrow.init()` is now alias for `autogrow.all()`. Makes it possible to upgrade from previous versions without breaking.
* Makes use of a `DocumentFragment` for better performance.
